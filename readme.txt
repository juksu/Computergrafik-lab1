The work submitted was created by Andreas Fuchs

Foreign code was used to realize this project. The foreign code can be found in the folder "common":
- gl-matrix.js from http://glmatrix.net 
	-> to perform matix calculations.
- webgl-utils.js from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL/blob/master/sdk/demos/common/webgl-utils.js 
	-> to setup webgl and check if the browser supports it.
- initShaders.js from Angel and Shreiner: Interactive Computer Graphics 
	-> initializes shader and creates a program.

Everything else is my own work.
